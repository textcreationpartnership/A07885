            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the nine and twenty day of September laſt paſt, there was an extraordinary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and ſecret meeting hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the city of Cullen: which done, in the afternoone, it being S. <hi>Michaels</hi> day, (which is to be noted) all the Maſons, Bricklayers, Carpenters and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, were called and aſſembled together, before the Magiſtrates, by whom they were told and willed to make them ſelues ready, with pickaxes, ſhouels, and other tooles, the night enſuing about three of the clocke in the morning, therewith vtterly to raze and breake downe the towne of Muhleim, vpon paine of being put from their trades of liuing, if they refuſed ſo to doe. This vnexpected warnjng put the workemen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no little feare, and perplexity, ſo that at
<pb facs="tcp:3013:3"/>the firſt they vtterly refuſed and denied to doe it, ſaying that it behoued them to ſet better ſoldiers a worke, in that peece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, then they were, alledging that they feared and greatly doubted that the ſtones thereof might and would then, or in time to come, breake their, or their childrens Shins: wherevnto the Magiſtrates made anſwere that they would be their warrant and protectors againſt all men for doing it. Wherevpon the worke men fully reſolued, that if the Burgo-Maſter and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the city, would goe before them &amp; be their guides, they would follow them: which they promiſed to doe. While this matter was in determination, the gates of the city were kept ſhut, that no man in the meane time ſhould goe out, to make report thereof abroad, and that the townes men of Mulheim might not haue intelligence of their pretence, to ſaue them ſelues by flight. At the ſame time there was a rumor ſpread abroad, that in the new market place, in the city of Cullen, there was a murther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb facs="tcp:3013:3"/>and that ſearch was then to be made for the murtherer: vnder this prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the night time, about 3. of the clock, which was the pretended time and houre appointed: <hi>Iohn Bowlant</hi> the Burgermaſter, and others of the Magiſtrates, went out of the gates; with ſuch a number of creſſets, fackles, linkes, and lanternes, that the night ſeemed to be as light as day, and after them the towns men followed to the number of 800. at the leaſt, beſides ſtraglers, hauing 200. ſoldiers, with pipes and drums, marching before them, to defend the worke men: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fell to worke, there was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion red vnto them to ſhew and certifie them, that it was not onely the Emperors and the Dukes pleaſure, to haue it done, but alſo the new-Burgers and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of Cullens will, who had ſought and procured the ſame, for the good &amp; welfare of the city of Cullen, &amp; the preſeruation of the citizens thereof: which done they fell to worke, firſt breaking downe the greateſt houſes, and ſo continued the ſpoyle the
<pb facs="tcp:3013:4"/>whole night, and all the next day vntill the firſt of October in the euening, whereby not a ſtone therof is left ſtanding one vpon the other. The bricks, free ſtones, lead, and iron, and that which would ſerue for any thing, was giuen vnto the Capucins, and al the ruines of the great Church. The French Church, with all the ruines thereof, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Fulldoers, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues brake downe. The great deep cellers and vaults, which could not well be broken in haſt, they tooke order that they ſhould be blowne vp with gunpouder, and that then the new houſes that had bin built in old Mulheim within the ſpace of foure yeares, ſhould be throwne downe. No man therein had any warning giuen him of the deſtruction thereof, nor any time permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to ſcape away: al the women (were they neuer ſo great with childe, or lying in childe bed) children, and men, were ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged and forbidden not to goe into Cologne, ſo that no man knowes whether they fled to ſaue them ſelues, for that, all
<pb facs="tcp:3013:4"/>thereabouts in ſome peſants houſes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in old Mulheim there lay many Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, that had more deſire to ſpoile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the poore diſtreſſed people running away, then to ſaue and harbor them. This heauy and ſorrowfull night, rayſed a great cry, pitifull noyſe, woe and clamor in the towne of Mulheim, ſpecially among poore women and children, for that moſt part of the Merchants of the Towne were then at Fanckfort Mart, and thoſe that dealt in wines, were gone vp into the country, to buy wine. To conclude, in this vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and cruell action, all the fauour ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them was, that they murthered not the poore diſtreſſed men, whoſe wofull cries clime vp and pierce into heauen, and make complaint vnto the great reuenger of all iniuries, and oppreſſed people, that with deuout prayer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend themſelues vnto him.</p>
